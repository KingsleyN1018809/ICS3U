#Predict:
print(24)
#This code will print out the number 24

#Modify

amount = 24
print(amount)

#This also give 24

print("Two dozen is: ", amount)

#This print: Two dozen is: 24

#Modify 2
amount = 7*4
print("forty-two is: ", amount)

#This will print out: forty-two is: 28

#Modify 3

amount = 8
amount = amount + 1
print("The amount is: ", amount)

#This will print out: The amount is: 9
#because this take the variable amount as 8 and then add in 1

#Modify 4

amount = 8
amount = amount * 2
print(amount)

#This will print out: 16
#Because this take the variable amount then multiply by 2
